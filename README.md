# **Product Specification: Simple Employee Feedback System**

## **Overview**
The Simple Employee Feedback System is a backend service designed to facilitate the submission, review, and response to employee feedback within an organization. 
Employees can provide feedback on their work experience, either anonymously or identified, which can then be reviewed and responded to by HR or Admin.

## **Objectives**
  - **Empower Employees:**
    Provide a platform for employees to share their experiences and feedback securely and anonymously if desired.
  - **Streamline Feedback Management:**
    Enable HR and Admin to view, filter, and respond to feedback efficiently.
  - **Improve Employee Satisfaction:**
    Foster a culture of transparency and responsiveness by addressing employee concerns promptly.

## **Key Features**
  1. **Employee Feedback Submission**
     - **API Endpoint:** Provide an API endpoint for employees to submit feedback.
     - **Anonymous Submission Option:** Employees can choose to submit feedback anonymously.
     - **Basic Validation:** Implement validation for feedback content (e.g., enforce a minimum length of feedback).
       
  2. **Feedback Viewing (HR/Admin only)**
     - **API Endpoint:** Provide an API endpoint for HR/Admin to view all submitted feedback.
     - **Filtering Options:** Allow HR/Admin to filter feedback based on date, department, or anonymity status.
       
  3. **HR Response to Feedback**
     - **API Endpoint:** Allow HR to respond to feedback through an API endpoint, provided the feedback is not anonymous.
     - **Linked Responses:** Store responses so that they are linked to the original feedback entry.
       
  4. **Feedback Status Tracking**
     - **Mark as Reviewed/Unreviewed:** Allow HR to mark feedback as reviewed or unreviewed.
     - **Status Checking API:** Provide an API endpoint for employees to check the status of their submitted feedback (if not anonymous).
